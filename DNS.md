Example:
```
{"type":"Host","fqdn":"example.acme.com","ip":"192.168.0.1","domain":"acme.com","company":"Acme","dns":{"type":"DNS","A":["192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.2"],"AAAA":["fe80::1"],"CNAME":["ex.acme.com"],"PTR":["ex.acme.com"],"MX":["example-acme-com.mail.protection.outlook.com"],"NS":["nameserver.acme.com"],TXT":["txtRecordString"]}}
```

Pretty Printed:
```
{
	"type":"Host",
	"fqdn":"example.acme.com",
	"ip":"192.168.0.1",
	"domain":"acme.com",
	"company":"Acme",
	"dns":{
		"type":"DNS",
		"A":["192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.2"],
		"AAAA":["fe80::1"],
		"CNAME":["ex.acme.com"],
		"PTR":["ex.acme.com"],
