### Port

The `PORT` object SHALL be used to describe the status of the ports on a specific `Host`. The `Port` object MUST be placed inside of one of the two ISO Model Layer 4 categories of the `Host` object. If attribute values are not known, they MUST NOT be included unless specified otherwise in the description below. See Port.md file for further usage for the `Host` object.


The `Port` object has the following attributes defined:
* `type`* - MUST be the type of object. In this case, `Port`.
* `port`* - MUST be the integer between 0 - 65535 that describes which port is open on this `Host`
* `state`* - MUST be the openness state of the port. Options: `closed`, `open`, `filtered`. Typically, `closed` ports SHOULD NOT be reported.
* `services` - MUST be a list of `Service` object(s) that describes the service(s) behind this port

\* Required attributes

Example:
```
{"type":"Host","fqdn":"example.acme.com","ip":"192.168.0.1","domain":"acme.com","company":"Acme","ports":{"tcp":[{"type":"Port","port":"22","state":"open"},{"type":"Port","port":"80","state":"open","services":[...]}],"udp":[]}}
```


Pretty Printed:
```
{
    "type":"Host",
    "fqdn":"example.acme.com",
    "ip":"192.168.0.1",
    "domain":"acme.com",
    "company":"Acme",
    "ports":{
        "tcp":[
            {
                "type":"Port",
                "port":"22"
                "state":"open"
            },
            {
                "type":"Port",
                "port":"80",
                "state":"open",
                "services":[...]
            }
        ],
        "udp":[]
        }
}
```
